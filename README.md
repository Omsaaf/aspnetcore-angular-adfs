# ADFS + Angular + ASP.NET CoreÂ API

In this repo provide an example for ADFS + Angular + ASP.NET Core API.

I needed to do these 3 things work together and I had a huge difficulty to find content about doing that. When it had information about Angular, it did not have about ASP.NET Core API, or it was about ASP.NET MVC projects. Oh, it was sad!

But now, I have those 3 things working together and I'd like to explain some couple things I learned and also provide a project that may help someone else.

So, check this out!
